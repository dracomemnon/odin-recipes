# Odin Recipes 🍳

## 📘 Description

This is my first HTML-only project as part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal of this project was to build a basic website using only HTML to practice:
- Semantic structure
- Lists
- Links and navigation
- Images
- Relative file paths

The project consists of a main index page and individual pages for three recipes.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Writing semantic HTML
- Linking multiple pages using anchor tags
- Using images with alt text
- Structuring clean, readable HTML
- Navigating and organizing a multi-page HTML project

## 🪞 Reflection

This project helped solidify my understanding of how to organize HTML files and link between them. I also practiced proper HTML syntax, indentation, and basic layout structure.

I'm ready to move into CSS and learn how to style everything I've built so far!
