        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind the four cups of egusi with a dry blender or hand-grinding machine 
                and set them aside in a bowl. Add about a cup of water to it and stir 
                to make a very thick paste</li>
            <li>Parboil the meat with all the ingredients, it is advisable to parboil meat
                 with some ingredients before adding them to the principal food, 
                 this improves the taste of the meat.</li>
            <li>Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender
                 and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of 
                 salt and a half cup of sliced onions.</li>
            <li>Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, 
                then set aside. Also, remove the center bone from the roasted fishes, 
                wash and set aside too.</li>
            <li>Set your cooking pot on the fire and add 300ml of palm oil (red oil),
                 allow to heat for a minute but donâ€™t allow to bleach. Add the egusi paste and 
                 keep stirring for the next eight to ten minutes to form seed-like crumbs.
                 Then transfer the already cooked meat into the pot, stir.</li>
            <li>Add the washed dry fish, stockfish, ground crayfish, a seasoning cube,
                ground scotch bonnet pepper, and 2 cups of water. Then cover halfway and allow 
                boiling for the next ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir occasionally to avoid burning. One spoon of ground dawadawa (local ingredients), and a taste for salt and pepper.

                Add a handful of sliced utazi leaves.

                Allow to simmer on low heat for 2 minutes, stir, and you just made a delicious pot of egusi soup</li>
